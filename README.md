## üå∏„ÉªHi !
I‚Äôm Ad√©la√Øde!

I create stuff, sometimes.
I make apps that work on apple platforms, using Swift and SwiftUI (along with UI/AppKit for few tweaks) !

I also know a bit of python, and may play a bit with server-side stuff.

I‚Äôm **Swift Student Challenge 2024 Distinguished Winner !**


## üå±„ÉªMy projects

### Egretta (Student Challenge winning project)

A simple, yet delightful dream journal app, emotion based and respectful of your privacy.
The app includes game mechanisms to push you to remember your dreams more and more, and is made for beginners as well as advanced users.
