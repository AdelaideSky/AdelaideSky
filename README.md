## üå∏„ÉªHi !
I‚Äôm Ad√©la√Øde!
A Software Engineering student from France. :)

I have always been surrounded by technology and started coding when I was 9. A few years ago, I started learning Swift and coding apps using SwiftUI, with some exploration of UIKit.

I have since worked on a few projects, with special care to UI and emotional connection with the user, some of them awarded by people from Apple and beyond.

I‚Äôm **Swift Student Challenge 2024 & 2025 Distinguished Winner !**

## üå±„ÉªMy projects

Most of my projects are closed-source for now (you may see horrible stuff in my public repositories - sorry !) but i have few things in the works that may be perfect as open source swift packages. :D

### Egretta (Student Challenge winning project)

A simple, yet delightful dream journal app, emotion based and respectful of your privacy.
The app includes game mechanisms to push you to remember your dreams more and more, and is made for beginners as well as advanced users.

On iOS, iPadOS, VisionOS to be released, and MacOS planned !
